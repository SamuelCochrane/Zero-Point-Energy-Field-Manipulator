# Zero-Point-Energy-Field-Manipulator
The Zero Point Energy Field Manipulator is a tractor beam-type object designed for handling hazardous materials and doing heavy lifting.

Zero-point energy (ZPE) is the lowest possible energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state as described by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Therefore, even at absolute zero, atoms and molecules retain some vibrational motion. 
Apart from atoms and molecules, the empty space of the vacuum also has these properties. 
According to quantum field theory, the universe can be thought of not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e., leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g., photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy.
